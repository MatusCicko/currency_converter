<h1>About</h1>
    <p align="justify"><mark><i>Please note that this web application is in an early stage and should be considered a working prototype, not a final website. If interested, please see the <a href="https://github.com/MatusCicko/currency_converter">project repository at GitHub</a>, which also offers a working command line program.</i></mark></p>
    <p align="justify">This simple web application made in Python serves as a utility to quickly and reliably convert values from one currency to another, or to multiple other currencies.</p>
    <p align="justify">The converter takes two required arguments - amount to be converted and the input currency to convert from. The output currency may or may not be given. If the output currency is provided, the app only converts the amount to the given currency. Otherwise it converts the amount to all enabled currencies.</p>
    <p align="justify">The currency arguments should preferably be entered in form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217">ISO 4217 currency codes</a>. Currency symbols are supported as well, however they come with a caveat. There is no official unifying ISO standard in case of currency symbols, therefore these can be ambiguous. The dollar sign ($) represents multiple currencies apart from the US dollar, including e.g. Australian or Canadian dollar. The list of supported symbols is thus limited in order to primarily represent the most widespread currencies. The complete list of supported currency names, codes and symbols can be accessed <a href="{{ url_for('list_currencies') }}">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="conversion-methods">Conversion methods</h3>
    <p align="justify">The app uses two different methods for the currency conversion. One of them depends on the <a href="https://docs.openexchangerates.org/docs/latest-json">API endpoint of openexchangerates.org</a> (&quot;OER&quot;), which provides hourly-updated exchange rates. This app uses a free plan at openexchangerates.org, which allows 1,000 requests per month. This limit is addressed by caching the rates data into a local file, meaning that the program is sending requests to the OER endpoint only once in an hour and then gets the rates data from the local cache.</p>
    <p align="justify">The other method of conversion is utilizing <a href="http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/">http://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/</a> website (&quot;XE&quot;), which accepts url arguments and returns an html page with the calculated conversion. This html page is then scraped and the converted amount is extracted. This method requires sending an HTTP request for every single conversion and may take long time (approx. 3 minutes) if the conversion is to be made for all known currencies. Therefore, this method is deprecated for converting to all currencies and should only be used with overridden currencies in the config file (configuration explained in the following section) or with a given output currency. The XE method could be significantly faster with asyncio and aiohttp, which might be implemented in future versions.</p>
    <p align="justify">Of these two methods, the OER is much faster, especially when using the cache, and it also supports more currencies. For these reasons, the OER method is used as default all the time, unless overridden in the config file or by a command line argument. The XE method serves mainly as a backup for OER in case of outages or other unexpected events. If any of the attempted methods fails, the app automatically attempts to do the conversion once again using the other method.</p>
    <p align="justify">The two methods were implemented also for the sake of demonstrating different approaches to currency conversion: requesting the conversion itself vs. requesting the exchange rates and doing the calculation locally.</p>
